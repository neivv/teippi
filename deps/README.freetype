The freetype/ directory includes the FreeType font library (Version 2.6) for Visual Studio,
whose source code can be acquired from http://download.savannah.gnu.org/releases/freetype/
See freetype\FTL.txt for the FreeType license.

This prebuilt library has only been tested to work with the Visual Studio 2015 compiler's debug
builds, and other setups may require compiling the library from source.
